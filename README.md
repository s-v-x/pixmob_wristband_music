# PIXMOB WRISTBAND RYTHM
## Introduction

This code allows you to synchronize the colors of the Pixmob wristband (used in Coldplay, Taylor Swift, Karol G and more shows) to the rhythm of the music using Arduino and Elegoo components in two variants:

1 - Manual adjustment based on detected sound levels: You can select different colors based on the sound level detected by the sound sensor. For example, you can set one color for silence, another for lower volume, a different one for slightly louder music, and so on, with as many colors as you like.

2 - Random color selection: The sensor detects a sound, generates a random number, and displays the color corresponding to that random number.

In any case, you can customize the number of colors and the method that best suits your preferences.
